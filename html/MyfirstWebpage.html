<h1>What is web development ?</h1> <!--section work  -->
 
 
<p>Web development is the building and maintenance of websites; it’s the work that happens behind the scenes to make a website look great, work fast and perform well with a seamless user experience.

    Web developers, or devs, do this by using a variety of coding languages. The languages they use depends on the types of tasks they are preforming and the platforms on which they are working.
    
    Web development skills are in high demand worldwide and well paid too – making development a great career option. It is one of the easiest accessible higher paid fields as you do not need a traditional university degree to become qualified.
    
    The field of web development is generally broken down into front-end (the user-facing side) and back-end (the server side). Let’s delve into the details.
</p>
<h1>Comparing Front-End and Back-End Development</h1>
<p>A front-end dev takes care of layout, design and interactivity using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. They take an idea from the drawing board and turn it into reality.

    What you see and what you use, such as the visual aspect of the website, the drop down menus and the text, are all brought together by the front-end dev, who writes a series of programmes to bind and structure the elements, make them look good and add interactivity. These programmes are run through a browser.
</p>
<p>
    The backend developer engineers what is going on behind the scenes. This is where the data is stored, and without this data, there would be no frontend. The backend of the web consists of the server that hosts the website, an application for running it and a database to contain the data.

The backend dev uses computer programmes to ensure that the server, the application and the database run smoothly together. This type of dev need to analyse what a company’s needs are and provide efficient programming solutions. To do all this amazing stuff they use a variety of server-side languages, like PHP, Ruby, Python and Java.
</p>
<h1>What about Full-Stack Development?</h1>
<p>
    If both Frontend and Backend development appeal to you, you could consider becoming a Full-Stack Developer.

Full-stackers take care of both the front-end and the back-end, and need to know how the web works on all levels, in order to determine how the client- and server-sides will relate. Naturally working up to this level of expertise will take longer, as there is more to learn.
</p>
<h1>Getting Started in Web Development</h1>
<p>
    All this may sound daunting at first, but you don’t need to know everything at once. You will grow your knowledge progressively. And things will begin to click. 

The great news is, learning to become a developer is easily accessible and affordable. This is especially true with OpenClassrooms. Emily Reese, Web developer and Teacher at OpenClassrooms explains,

    Whatever aspect of web development attracts you, we have programs that can help you reach your goals.

No matter your background, you can learn web development. Emily told us,

    In undergrad, I studied art history and architecture and then decided to become a developer whilst I was working at Kickstarter because I saw how the web could complement creativity in the arts. The same is probably true for any field.

    Becoming a web professional allows you to participate in absolutely any field, because the web has become universally present in our professional lives. You can be a web developer and specialize in anything from the art world to the automobile industry.

<h1>Your First 10 HTML Tags</h1>
<p>Just starting out with HTML? Here are 10 essential HTML tags that you’ll need to know when building your web pages. If you learn how these 10 tags work then you’ll have enough knowledge to put together a basic page.

    At the end of the tutorial you’ll find code for an example web page that includes all 10 tags, so that you can see how to use them.
</p>
<h1>Tags and elements</h1>
<p>
    An HTML tag is a special word or letter surrounded by angle brackets,  and . You use tags to create HTML elements, such as paragraphs or links.

Many elements have an opening tag and a closing tag — for example, a p (paragraph) element has a p tag, followed by the paragraph text, followed by a closing /p tag.

Some elements don’t have a closing tag. These are called empty elements. For example, the br element for inserting line breaks is simply written br.

If you’re working with XHTML then you write empty elements using self-closing tags — for example, br /.

Now let’s look at those 10 tags!
</p>  
<p>                                                                   <!--section work  -->
>html … /html — The root element <br />                                   <!--section work  -->
head … /head — The document head  <br />                               <!--section work  -->
title … /title — The page title   <br />                                <!--section work  -->
body … /body — The page’s content    <br />                              <!--section work  -->
h1 … /h1 — A section heading<br />
p … /p — A paragraph<br />
a … /a — A link<br />
img — An image<br />
div … /div — A block-level container for content<br />
span … /span — An inline container for content<br />
</p> 
</div>

<h1>CSS first steps overview</h1>
<p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and lay out web pages — for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features. This module provides a gentle beginning to your path towards CSS mastery with the basics of how it works, what the syntax looks like, and how you can start using it to add styling to HTML.
</p>
<p>
    What’s the first thing for any website to create a good impression on a user? … 

Yes…it’s the user interface for any website. Every developer knows how important it is to create a beautiful design for users to interact with any website. Giving styling to the web pages smartly in a minimal amount of time is not an easy task if you don’t have a good knowledge of CSS and it’s selectors. CSS selectors target the specified elements in an HTML document and help developers to apply styling to the web pages. You might have knowledge of some basic CSS selectors but a bit more than basic knowledge helps in achieving your goal faster. Using the right CSS selectors minimize the amount of code, makes it more readable, and makes the CSS simpler to maintain that in the future.
</p>
<h1>Element or Group Selector</h1>
<p>
    This is one of the most basic selector to use in CSS. Element selector allows you to select and give styling to all elements with the same specified element name. If there are multiple elements with the same style definitions, you can group all the elements and apply styling to all of them together. This way you can minimize the code because you won’t have to use class for each of the elements. 
</p>
<h1>#id selector </h1>
<p>
    id selector is the other most powerful common selector in CSS. Using the # symbol followed by id name allows you to target by id and apply styling to all specified elements with a selected id. Using this selector sounds good because of its simplicity but keep in mind that id should be unique for the entire web page. It means you are not allowed to assign an id selector for multiple elements. If you won’t assign unique id you will face problems in manipulating a specific element in JavaScript. Also, your code will not be validated by W3C and you will face compatibility issues across different browsers. So instead of creating many #id’s use classes or any other logic for styling, else it will be tough to maintain your CSS later on.
</p>
<h1>class selector</h1>
<p>
    Class selector is the most useful common selector used by the developers. You can define the class selector using period (.) followed by the class name. It gives styling to all elements with a specified class attribute. It is similar to the id selector but the only difference is, class selector allows you to target multiple elements in a page. You can also use multiple classes (separated by a space) on HTML elements.
